== Toy Robot Navigator 

  This is the readme file for an the code which attempts at simulating the navigation of a toy robot on a table top without letting it fall.

== Dependencies
  
  This code is developed and tested on ruby 2.1.1p76 (2014-02-24 revision 45161) [x86_64-linux].
  This should work with all versions of ruby > 1.9.2. (used 'require_relative' method which is ruby 1.9.2+ compatible only. 
  Just change it incase to support earlier versions of ruby)

== Assumptions

1) Robot moves only along the known directions north, west, east and south.
2) Robot can only turn either left or right.
3) Robot always takes equi-distant steps.

== To Run

  1)  Script - Go to the directory which has this script and type (ex- code)

      Input can be provided to the script in two ways a) interactively & b) Through file

      a) Interactively - 

          run - ruby robot_navigator.rb (Enter commands one by one and press return key after each command)
          Ex - ruby robot_navigator.rb
          >> PLACE 0,2,SOUTH
          >> MOVE
          >> LEFT
          >> REPORT
          >> quit

      b) Through file - 

          run - ruby robot_navigator.rb [file_path_with_commands]
          Ex - ruby robot_navigator.rb sample_commands.txt


  2) Tests - TEsts are written with ruby unit testing framework. 
      Go to the directory which has test file and type (ex- code)
      ruby test/robot_navigator_test.rb

      A Sample Run - 

      >>  ruby test/robot_navigator_test.rb

          Run options: 

          # Running tests:
